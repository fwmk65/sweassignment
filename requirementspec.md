# 3. Project Development (20% - Max 2 Pages)

## 3.1 Development Approach

The development approach we have chosen to use is scrum development. The decision to go for an
agile approach to development was made to reflect the changes that can happen at different points throughout the 
project, like the COVID-19 situation affecting how people will move around the hospital or the DRI requesting more
features further down the line. The workflow will involve our teammates being assigned a job to work on for the week
and the team will meet at least once a week in the assigned practical session to discuss progress and move people
around to different tasks where appropriate. We may also use DevOps features built into Github Actions such as commit hooks to automate parts of the development like testing. This prorgress will be recorded on a Trello board and in our GitHub repository and meetings with the client will be arranged to discuss progress or changes. We can
keep this workflow for the whole project. 

This workflow is useful for a few reasons. The first is that it gives us flexibility to accomodate features 
and changing requirements in the future, as well as giving us time to work around full student schedules. This 
development approach is also much more suitable than the Waterfall approach since we know that parts of the project
are subject to change, so a full waterfall approach where we analyse, design, code and test will take a long time and
changing requirements will hurt our development and lead to wasted time. Working this way allows us to focus on what the client wants from their software and how we will best
meet their needs. 


## 3.2 Project Schedule

The schedule for our project is heavily based on the university deadlines for each assignment. These key dates can be seen in the table below. Milestones during the
development process, such as a feature being finished, are harder to give direct timescales for this early on in the project however some very rough estimates can be given 
based on the features that depend on each other. All milestones marked as "University Assigned" are pieces of documentation required by the University as part of the 
module grade and were all released at the same time.

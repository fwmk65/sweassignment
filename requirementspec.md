|Exception handling |Example|

|ID Type and Title|FR 2 Use of AI to process user input|
|---|---|
|Description       |A user can use speech input to start a route e.g. "take me to the car park". This will be <br>                     processed by an AI using natural language processing and then the route will be started.|
|Priority          |High|
|Must Should Could |Must|
|Dependencies      |FR 3|
|Expected results |When a user inputs speech to the application it will be processed quickly and the application <br> will provide a route relevant to the given audio input.|
|Exception handling  |When a user provides irrelevant audio input e.g. what is the weather today the application  <br>                will warn user that input is invalid.<br><br>If the user requests a route to a building that doesn't exist e.g. "Where is the church" <br> the application will provide an output like cannot find building "church".|

## 2.3 Risks and Issues
- Storing data on the user could possibly violate GDPR
  - Make data Handling GDPR compliant

- Make sure database is robust as the whole systen relies on it
  - Use regular backups in case of any error

- Misuse of the admin section could result in many issues e.g. incorrect locations or inappropriate names being shown to users.
  - Make access to admin section robust e.g. 2FA

### Communication Issues:

1. The group members come from different cultural backgrounds, which may cause disagreements
2. Poor communication with customers
3. The progress will be complicated later than expected
4. In the middle of development, it was discovered that there were errors in the basic items that were originally confirmed from the beginning, which caused the entire project to be overthrown and restarted.

### Technical issues:

5. The expected functions cannot fully/partially meet the expected requirements
6. The program cannot cope with emergencies
7. The program cannot cope with the consequences of human operations, such as administrator errors, etc.

| Number | Priority | Loss | Prabability |
| ---- | ----   | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | High   | It at least delays the delivery, or even fails the project. | High probability, but will not lead to the worst in general. |
| 2    | Medium | This will lead to errors between expectations and the project, and untimely communication may waste time and effort. | Medium probability. |
| 3    | Medium | Reduce the customer's rating of the project team, and disrupt the global plan. | High probability |
| 4    | Medium | It takes a lot of time and energy to correct the direction of the project. | Low probability |
| 5 | Low | The completion of the project does not meet customer requirements. | Medium probability |
| 6 | Low | The project cannot complete the task requirements under any circumstances. | Low probability |
| 7 | Low | The project may collapse under human intervention. | Medium probability |

 ### Cope with the risk

1. Establish communication channels (via Github, Whats app, etc.) to clarify the work that each team member needs to do and the deadline for completion. Timely discover and mediate disputes and disagreements within the team.
2. By appointing the person in charge to contact the customer regularly (via e-mail, Trello, etc.) to ensure that the development of the project meets the requirements of the customer's expectations.
3. Develop an effective time schedule (note that, leave a certain buffer space for each item that needs to be processed or completed) and change the time schedule accordingly when the time, technology, personnel, and other conditions change.
4. It is necessary to clarify the purpose and development route in a timely manner in the early stage of the project, and maintain a smooth communication route with customers and instructors.
5. Communicate with the customer clearly to disambiguate, understand what needs to be changed or added, and then take remedial measures afterwards.
6. By adding tests that simulate on-line running to verify the actual running results and simulate various unexpected scenarios for the project to verify the robustness. And need to do a considerable degree of research on the environment of customer needs.
7. Ask the customer about the docking environment, and simulate the modification of the data under the administrator operation scenario, and limit certain administrator and user permissions based on the simulation results.

  Various situations that may arise in the test should be taken into consideration in the establishment of the project

# 3. Project Development (20% - Max 2 Pages)

## 3.1 Development Approach

The development approach we have chosen to use is scrum development. The decision to go for an
agile approach to development was made to reflect the changes that can happen at different points throughout the 
project, like the COVID-19 situation affecting how people will move around the hospital or the DRI requesting more
features further down the line. The workflow will involve our teammates being assigned a job to work on for the week
and the team will meet at least once a week in the assigned practical session to discuss progress and move people
around to different tasks where appropriate. We may also use DevOps features built into Github Actions such as commit hooks to automate parts of the development like testing. This prorgress will be recorded on a Trello board and in our GitHub repository and meetings with the client will be arranged to discuss progress or changes. We can
keep this workflow for the whole project. 

This workflow is useful for a few reasons. The first is that it gives us flexibility to accomodate features 
and changing requirements in the future, as well as giving us time to work around full student schedules. This 
development approach is also much more suitable than the Waterfall approach since we know that parts of the project
are subject to change, so a full waterfall approach where we analyse, design, code and test will take a long time and
changing requirements will hurt our development and lead to wasted time. Working this way allows us to focus on what the client wants from their software and how we will best
meet their needs. 


## 3.2 Project Schedule

The schedule for our project is heavily based on the university deadlines for each assignment. These key dates can be seen in the table below. Milestones during the
development process, such as a feature being finished, are harder to give direct timescales for this early on in the project however some very rough estimates can be given 
based on the features that depend on each other. All milestones marked as "University Assigned" are pieces of documentation required by the University as part of the 
module grade and were all released at the same time.
